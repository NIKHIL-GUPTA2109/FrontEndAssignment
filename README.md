Drag and Drop Interface
This is a simple web page that demonstrates the implementation of a drag and drop interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page allows users to drag and drop items between two containers.

Description
The drag and drop interface consists of two containers displayed side by side. The first container (container1) is populated with a list of items, which can be images, text, icons, or any other content. The second container (container2) is initially empty.

Users can click and drag an item from container1 to container2. While dragging, the appearance of the dragged item changes to provide visual feedback. Once the user drops the item into container2, it is appended to the container, and a success message is displayed below the containers.

The interface also includes a reset button. Clicking the reset button clears container2 and resets container1 to its original state, removing any items that were previously dropped.

How to Use
To use the drag and drop interface, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
You will see two containers side by side. The first container (container1) contains some items.
Click and hold on an item in container1.
Drag the item and move the mouse cursor to container2.
Release the mouse button to drop the item into container2.
A success message will be displayed indicating that the item was dropped successfully.
To reset the containers, click the "Reset" button. This will clear container2 and restore container1 to its original state.
Feel free to experiment with different items and customize the code to fit your requirements.
